# Data Lakes with Spark on AWS

This is my submission to Udacity Data Engineer Data Lakes project.

## Introduction

The objective is to meet the needs of a startup called Sparkify which has an activity similar to Spotify or Deezer.

Sparkify has grown their user base and song database and want to ***move their data warehouse to a data lake***. 
Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, 
as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As data engineers, we are tasked with building an ***ETL pipeline*** that extracts 
their data from ***S3***, processes them using ***Spark***, 
and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. 
This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

We'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team 
from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description


In this project, we'll apply what you've learned on ***Spark and data lakes*** to build an ETL pipeline 
for a data lake hosted on S3. 

## What we'll need to do

1. Understand the datasets and design schemas for your fact and dimension tables
2. Create an EMR cluster on AWS
3. Load data from S3 
4. Process the data into analytics tables
5. Load them back into S3

## Libraries

```
from datetime import datetime # The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession # The entry point into all functionality in Spark
from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col # To use user define function
from pyspark.sql.functions import hour, dayofmonth, weekofyear, month, year, dayofweek # To manipulate date
import pyspark.sql.types # Import type
```

## Projet Datasets

We'll be working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

* Song data: ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data```
* Log data: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data```

Log data json path: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json```

## Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in ***JSON format*** and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
````

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

## Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in ***JSON format*** generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset we'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and event datasets, we'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

### Fact Table

1. ***songplays*** - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page ```NextSong```
* songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

### Dimension Tables

2. ***users*** - users in the app
* user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level

3. ***songs*** - songs in music database
* song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration

4. ***artists*** - artists in music database
* artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude

5. ***time*** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
* start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project Template

The initial project template includes five files:

* ***etl.py*** is where we'll load data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift and then process 
that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.
* ***dl.cfg*** is where we'll provide necessary information for AWS (information will be use in other files). 
*** I've suppress this file, because we'll launch our etl directly from our EMRcluster.***

I've add one file:

* ***EMR_cluster.md*** 
a step by step approach to create your EMR cluster on AWS
is where we'll create our cluser and role on aws. If you want you can create it directly on AWS (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html)
